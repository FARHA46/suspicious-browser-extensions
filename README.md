# suspicious-browser-extensions

I reviewed the Browser Extensions carefully,
identified unused and malicious extension at my Chrome.
I uninstalled it because the Malicious extension can harm the Credentials of the user,
track the browsing activity and  do much more.
it's essential to check the Malicious browser extension to keep the Credentials Secure.
